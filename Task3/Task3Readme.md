### TASK 3
#### It is the third and the most demanding app made for dev-test. Three methods for handling input, separating non-joint graphs and joining them respectively till all possible non-joint graphs remains.
#### Like other apps waiting for input from standard I/O this one is also launched from IDE(main method) or from command prompt (javac Task3.java , java Task3). Java 9+ is required
#### Like mentioned in task description first input line must be positive number n, and n pairs positive integers. Stay focused. No validation nor exception handling or tests. Please give some feedback if you want some tests, or if you find some bugs. It was not mentioned.
#### Separating non-joint graphs is useful to work with large collections. There is simpler solution by recursive joining graphs in the same collection but evaluation if elements are separate or not is done for the same elements many times. Because of performance I decided better choice is dividing for disjoint graphs collection and another collection as working area to joint remaining graphs.
