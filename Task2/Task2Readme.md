###TASK 2 

####Algorithmic task resolved by using Collection package. Returns all the pairs that sum up to 13.
####The way to run application is calling main from IDE or with usage command prompt to call javac Task2.java and java Task2 sequentially. This app awaits for input from standard I/O, so running this app wasn't additionally modified.
####It accepts series of integers. Input should be like "1 2 10 7 5 3 6 6 13 0"
####No input validation nor exception handling, so be careful.
####Future development should include at least tests and input validation.
