 Another algorithmic task resolved by using Collection package.
 It accepts series of integers pairs. Once again without exception handling and validation, so be careful.
 The code works for negative and positive numbers.  Input should be like "1 2 10 7 5 3 6 6 13 0"
 The way to run application is calling main from IDE or with usage command prompt to call javac Task2.java and java Task2 sequentially. 
 This app awaits for input from standard I/O, so running this app wasn't additionally modified.
 

### Task2
Again, the input is a long list of integers. Provide a working code that will find all the pairs (in this integer list) that sum up to 13. Each pair in the output should have first number not greater than the second one and lines should be sorted in an ascending order.

Sample:

For the input:

```
1 2 10 7 5 3 6 6 13 0

```

expected output is:

```
0 13
3 10
6 7
6 7
```
